# Reauthoring: A Toolkit to create Learning Resources

Welcome to Reauthoring, a toolkit to create learning material with active
components. The functionality is an extension of
[Sphinx-doc](http://sphinx-doc.org) and the overall idea is to create HTML
documents with active components that render nicely in both computer and mobile
browsers and can be useful as learning resources.

The best way to start is looking at an example of pages generated by the
toolkit. Take a look at the site resulting from
[downloading this project and running the toolkit on it](http://abelardopardo.com/Reauthoring).

If liked the look and feel of that site and want to try it yourself, follow the
steps to install a few tools, get ready to type commands in a window, and
create your own set of HTML pages.

## Steps to install the Authoring Toolkit


### Install Python (2.7.9) and Sphinx (latest version)

	[Install Python and Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html)

---
 
### Install sphinx_rtd_theme

	Open a command window and type:

	`pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`

	You may check the
    [instructions to install Sphinx RTD Theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme)

### Create a sample site

	The sample site is available through the [bitbucket reauthoring repository](https://bitbucket.org/abelardopardo/reauthoring)

	1. Go to https://bitbucket.org/abelardopardo/reauthoring/downloads
  
	2. Download the repository. 
  
	3. Unpack the ZIP in a folder in your own computer (in which you have
       installed Sphinx). Alternatively to these steps you could have simply
       cloned the repository with `git`.
    
	4. Open a command window in windows
  
    5. Go to the folder where you downloaded the repository. There should be a
       file called `conf.py` in that folder.
       
    6. Type the command `make html` in the command window
	   
	7. Open the browser and look at the file _build/html/index.html that was
       created in that same folder. You should be looking at a sample of a set
       of pages created using the authoring toolkit.

Happy designing!

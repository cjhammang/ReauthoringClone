## Create a sample site

  The sample site is available through the [bitbucket reauthoring repository](https://bitbucket.org/abelardopardo/reauthoring)

  1. Go to https://bitbucket.org/abelardopardo/reauthoring/downloads
  
  2. Download the repository.
  
  3. Unpack the ZIP in a folder in your own computer (in which you have
    installed Sphinx)
    
  4. Open a command window in windows
  
  5. Go to the folder where you downloaded the repository. There should be a
    file called conf.py in that folder.
    
  6. Type the command "make html" in the command window
  
  7. Open the browser and look at the file _build/html/index.html that was
    created in that same folder. You should be looking at a sample of a set of
    pages created using the authoring toolkit. 

Happy designing!
